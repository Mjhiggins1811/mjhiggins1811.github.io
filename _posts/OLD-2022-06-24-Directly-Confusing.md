title: Directly Confusing
---

So Nintendo had their big E3 direct yesterday! Which is great news if you care about Xenobalde Chronicles 3 because that’s all they talked about. As I’m sure you already know by now, it was a Xenoblade showcase. 20 minutes of all the latest info and trailers for the big N’s least anticipated title of 2022.

It’s pretty clear that what ever department in Nintendo is responsible for the direct side of marketing is in the middle of some sort of bitter conflict with the other members of the same department. Last years E3 hit hard, surprise dropping Metroid Dread (which, as a Metroid fan, is the only thing worth talking about) and giving us a glimpse at Breath of the Wild 2. Later in the year we got the pure weapons grade brilliance of Chris Pratt Mario, as well as Kirby and the Forgotten Land and N64 games coming to switch online (at a premium, of course).
This slew of what the gamers call hype meant Nintendo was, I think, a pretty serious contender in the battle for people’s attention last year, and of course the Switch’s history of killer titles driving pocket-bursting sales for Nintendo goes someway to prove this. In short, Directs are cool, I like watching them and so does the rest of the internet. It seemed like Nintendo had learnt this lesson as we entered 2022 with their February direct showing off the booster pack for Mariokart 8 and a return to the Mario Strikers series. Was this the perfect opening flourish to another year of hype-driving, Switch selling directs? Many thought so, but it appears the other faction within the department has got hold of the reigns again. And apparently they’re big Xenoblade fans.

Nintendo have so much to talk about this year. They must have something to say about at least some of the massive titles they’re keeping in reserve for what feels like my entire life. Metroid prime 4 has been in development since 2017 (albeit a development that was restarted in 2019), surely there’s something more to show us than a very big space 4 by now. Breath of the Wild 2, Splatoon 3, probably another Mario sports game, that switch online gba leak that I’m taking as fact because I enjoy disappointment. Just like one of these things coupled with the usual indie and third-party stuff would make one of those directs both fans and Nintendo’s shareholders dream about while they’re ignoring the Tom Nook body pillow.

But no. Xenoblade Chronicles 3. That’s what you’re getting and you’re going to like it.

Now Nintendo might still do an actual E3 direct. They’ve got time and I kind of think they still will because there just isn’t any reason not to. The point is what the fucks going on over there? Is everything OK? Would you like a cup of tea and biscuit so we can talk about it? I’m worried about you big N, and you haven’t given me Metriod Prime 4 yet or even any proof that it’s still alive so I can’t give up on you yet.
