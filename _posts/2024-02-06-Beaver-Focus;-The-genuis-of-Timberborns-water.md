title: "Beaver Focus: The Genius of Timberborns Water"
---

Everyone's favourite beaver city builder Timberborn got its fifth big update recently and, as ever, I have been forced to abandon the few responsibilities I had and devote all my time to building and maintaining a successful beaver society. My family haven't heard from me in weeks. I've got a new family. A beaver family.

So it's a pretty good game. I've been thinking about it a lot and I think it's success as a city builder comes down to a pretty fundamental aspect of it's design that holds some useful lessons about game design and about well made art in general.

Whats this fundamental truth? Is it beavers? Are the only good pieces of art those that involve beavers? Perhaps, but the art worlds not ready for that yet. No, what I'm talking about it how Timberborn choses its central thing (other than beavers) and makes *everything* in the game about that. Timberborn's not just a beaver role playing sim; it's a game about water.

The central thing you'll end up doing the most on any playthrough of Timberborn is managing water. Damming rivers to make reservoirs, using dynamite to carve out new channels to transport water and with this latest update directing the flow of the badwater to keep your beavers and their crops safe from its toxic effects.

This is, of course, because the game has been designed so that the only thing that really matters is water. It irrigates your crops and the forests, it powers your lumber yards, keeps your beavers from dying of thirst. Both water and its new alter-ego badwater are essential ingredients in many of the games production chains. In short, take any mechanic in Timberborn and it won't be more that a few steps away from building a damn or carving out river beds.

The two ecological events, droughts and badwater tides, organically force the player to artificially manage water and here lies the games central mechanic. Simply put, the starting maps don't leave your beavers equipped to survive much more than the first couple of droughts. Since everything is so closely tied into the need for water, as soon as the flow is turned off everything falls apart. The game's not shy about punishing the unprepared, and Timberborn players will likely remember their first settlements quickly succumbing to dehydration and watching all their beavers go up to the great dam in the sky.

So whats a player to do? Since a lack of water is obviously and naturally communicated to player as the problem since everything was likely fine in their beaver utopia until a drought or badwater, the solution presents itself; more water. Players will go to the building menus and, probably after finding the early game on-land water storage tanks to be lacking, will conclude that these dam things are probably the way to go. And so it begins. Fifty hours later they'll be designing an irrigation system better than most developed countries.

The lack-lustre early game tanks, the dedicated landscaping (ie dam) menu, the ecological events and the game's systems being so closely tied into the water all combine to give this game it's killer move. The sheer focus that Timberborn has on its one central selling point (managing water systems) combine into a masterclass on management game design that despite still being in early access manages to be one of the best city-builders I've played in years.

The lesson, then? Keep focus. Any game, any movie, any piece of art is at its best when it's absolutely *about* something. Ardman's Chicken Run sequel came out recently and I was disappointed to find (yet perhaps unsurprised) that it was no where near as good as the original. This is, of course, because the titan of british chicken war films that the original was had this complete focus on a central thing.

Everything from the land-girl come prisoner of war chickens and the US G.I meets simple English girl love story to the Dad's Army rooster and the industrial hell of the pie factory combines to pursue this films one goal. At its heart Chicken run is one extended reference to the general cultural idea of a second world war film. With chickens. And everything about the film contributes to that end. The sequel has nothing like this. It's a loosely put together Austin Powers/James Bond reference that has its main cast as chickens.

So that's what I've been thinking about for the last few weeks. Ironically, since I've been anything but, my mind has been occupied with focus. As ever, it's mastery of the basics that positions both Timberborn firmly at the top of not only the 'it's-this-thing-but-with-animals' genre, but at the top of, well, good art. Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got some dams to build.
